infection control	A set of practices and procedures that prevent or stop the spread of infection in healthcare settings
microorganisms	Living creatures that are too small to see with the naked eye
non-pathogens	a microorganism that is not capable of causing a disease
pathogens	disease causing agents
bacteria	one-celled microorganisms that are classified by shape; can produce spores
spores	preserve genetic material and help bacteria survive harsh environments
parasite	An organism that feeds on a living host
fungi	plant-like microorganisms that can be found in the air, in soil, on plants, or in water
virus	smallest type or microorganism that causes disease by invading host cells where they take nutrients to multiply
endogenous infection	caused by microorganisms already present in the human body
exogenous infection	caused by microorganisms or pathogens entering the human body from the outside environment
noscomial infections/ healthcare-acquired infections	acquired by a person while in the healthcare setting
opportunistic infection	occur when the body's defenses/immune system are weak
infectious disease	results from an invasion of microorganisms
communicable disease	a disease that is spread from one host to another
chain of infection	conditions that must be met to pass a disease from one person to another
asepsis	condition free of pathogens
medical asepsis/clean technique	maintaining a clean environment in order to reduce the number of pathogens
surgical asepsis	maintaining a sterile environment such as that found in operating rooms
sterile field/sterile technique	environment that is free from all microorganisms and spores
sterilization	highest level of asepsis, type of surgical asepsis that kills all microorganisms, including viruses and spores
disinfection	middle level of asepsis
cleaning	lowest level of asepsis and is the removal of visible organic or inorganic material from objects and surfaces
hand cleansing	most basic and important type of medical asepsis and is the number one way to prevent infection
mode of transmission	a way that the causative agent can be transmitted to another reservoir or host where it can live
reservoir	a place for the infectious agent to live and grow (could be human, animal, or any surface).
portal of exit	the way that pathogens leave the body (blood, bodily fluids, excretions)
portal of entry	the way that pathogens enter the new reservoir
direct transmission	transmission of pathogens through contact or droplets (including shaking hands), kissing, coughing, sneezing, and talking
indirect transmission	transmission of pathogens through the air (airborne), food, water, blood (vehicleborne) or an organism (vectorborne)
